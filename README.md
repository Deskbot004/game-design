## Main menu
### Play
After pushing the **Play**-Button the user can chose a deck for himself and the enemy, each with unique card ratios.

After pushing the **Start Game**-Button the game begins.

## Gameplay
### Types of Cards
There are two card types. Distinguished by Form.
- *Basic Cards*: Cards with a round window and a symbol corresponding to the rock, paper, scissors game. These cards have slots which can be filled with support cards. These cards can be played onto a slot in the middle of the table.
- *Support Cards*: These cards can not be played on their own and need to be attached to a basic card. These cards have special effects which affect the resolution of play.

### Gameplay-Loop
After the cards are dealt the Game-loop begins:
1. Cards for the turn are drawn.
2. The Enemy plays cards with (Based on enemy preference and hand cards) support cards attached.
3. (Optional) The User can attach support cards by right clicking a basic card and then dragging a fitting support card (indicated by the slot to be filled) onto the card. If the user wants to remove the attached support card **Detach** should be clicked. Else the combination is to be confirmed by **Done**.
4. The User can fill as many slots as he likes with basic cards, via drag and drop, and confirms the gamestate with **End Turn**.
5. Basic cards with their support cards get evaluated and for each loss on each slot the loser takes damage.
6. The Cycle repeats.

The loop ends after a player hits a lifetotal of 0 or below and the Option to **Restart** with the same decks or **Return** to the main menu is presented.
